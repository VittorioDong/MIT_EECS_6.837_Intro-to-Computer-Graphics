## Introduction

I'm pleased to share my successfully completed programming assignments from the "Intro to Computer Graphics" (MIT 6.837) course. This course offered an in-depth understanding of the core principles of computer graphics, covering topics from the graphical pipeline to complex algorithms such as Ray Tracing.

This project encompasses a series of assignments each focusing on a different aspect of computer graphics like Transformations, Hierarchical Modeling, Camera, Lights and Materials, Ray Casting and Ray Tracing. Each assignment presented its unique challenges, giving me the chance to dive deep into the subject.

## Repository Structure

In this repository, you will find each assignment organized in their respective directories. Each directory contains all the necessary source files and resources.

## Requirements & Setup

To run this project, you'll need the following:

1. A compiler supporting C++11
2. OpenGL library
3. FreeGLUT library
