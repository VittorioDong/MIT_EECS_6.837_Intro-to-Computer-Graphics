# MIT_EECS_6.837_Intro-to-Computer-Graphics
I am excited to share that I have successfully completed the programming assignments of the "Intro to Computer Graphics" (MIT 6.837) course. The course provided a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles of computer graphics. From learning about the graphical pipeline to understanding and implementing complex algorithms such as Ray Tracing, it was an exhilarating experience.

The project includes multiple assignments, each targeting a specific aspect of computer graphics such as Transformations, Hierarchical Modeling, Camera, Lights and Materials, Ray Casting and Ray Tracing. Each one has provided me with a unique challenge and the opportunity to delve deeper into the subject matter.

You'll find each assignment meticulously completed, with code that's as clear and clean as possible. I've ensured to comment extensively to aid comprehension and encourage further exploration.

Feel free to explore the repository. I hope that my work on these assignments can serve as a useful resource for other computer graphics enthusiasts and learners out there. For those wanting to learn more about computer graphics, I highly recommend this course!

Special thanks to MIT and the course instructors for providing such a valuable resource.
